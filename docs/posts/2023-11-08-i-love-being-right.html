<p>Yesterday’s session wasn’t great. It wasn’t bad either! Although I was card dead for most of the time, a revelation struck me during one hand. I don’t have that much against losing money, as long as I am right. I hate being wrong.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>I distinctly remember tagging one certain hand as good, and apparently there was only one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dealt to Hero: Td As</p>
<p>UTG Folds<br />
HERO Raises To $0.06<br />
CO Calls $0.06<br />
BTN Calls $0.06<br />
SB Folds<br />
BB Folds</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Flop ($0.21): 9s Ac 9h<br />
HERO Bets $0.07 (Rem. Stack: $1.87)<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CO Folds<br />
BTN Raises To $0.41 (Rem. Stack: $0.74)<br />
HERO Calls $0.34 (Rem. Stack: $1.53)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn ($1.03): 9s Ac 9h 6h<br />
HERO Checks<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BTN Bets $0.74 (allin)<br />
HERO Calls $0.74 (Rem. Stack: $0.79)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>River ($2.51): 9s Ac 9h 6h 5h</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BTN shows: 8c 7s</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BTN wins: $2.42</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I begin by raising, and although I didn’t think too much of the button’s short stack, I believe my hand is good enough to raise in any case. Both the CO and BTN calls. The flop should hit my range pretty hard, and I have an ace, so I raise by a third.</p>
<p>The button raises, massively. I don’t remember what read I had on the guy, but I’m pretty sure I found him very LAG, and bad. I have an ace, and it’s pretty unlikely he has a nine (there’s two on the board), so I call. On the turn, he goes in with the rest. I figured he’s bluffing, so I called. I was right. My equity was way higher than his, but he rivered a straight and took down the pot. I first thought that it sucked, but then came to the realization that if I keep calling all-ins with 84.1% equity, then I’d be very glad. I’m still playing for cheese burgers, so I’m just glad I was right.</p>
<h2 id="for-review">For review</h2>
<p>I didn’t tag any hands as specifically bad, but I did put the tag <em>for review</em> on one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dealt to Hero: As Qs</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTG Raises To $0.04<br />
HJ Folds<br />
CO Folds<br />
BTN Folds<br />
SB Folds<br />
HERO Raises To $0.16<br />
UTG Raises To $0.40<br />
HERO Calls $0.24</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Flop ($0.81): 2d 4c Jh<br />
HERO Checks<br />
UTG Checks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn ($0.81): 2d 4c Jh 6c<br />
HERO Checks<br />
UTG Checks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>River ($0.81): 2d 4c Jh 6c 2s<br />
HERO Checks<br />
UTG Checks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTG shows: Ad Kc<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTG wins: $0.78<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the guy 4bet me, he had only 10BBs left in his stack. In hindsight, maybe I should have gone all in. The action was very awkward during the rest of the streets where none of use gained anything. He still had only 10BB, which I noted during the hand, but I don’t think a bet would have made him fold, since he only had 10BB behind and much more invested. So to not lose more, I just check down and lose. Pretty sad hand.</p>
<h2 id="before-todays-session">Before today’s session</h2>
<p>I’ll read about what I should do against shorter stacked players at my table in cash games. And as per usual, remind myself of the tips in Little’s cheat sheet.</p>
