        <p>I’ve gotten into the habit of writing these analyses before the day’s session. It’s nice, as I have time to digest whatever happened during the session and cool down from whatever tilt that came from it. Yesterday’s outcome:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Total won ($)</th>
<th>VPIP%</th>
<th>PFR%</th>
<th>3Bet%</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1.92</td>
<td>23.5</td>
<td>17.4</td>
<td>8.9</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Actually, the session was split up in two, but for the stats that’s not something a little</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}P(H_i)P(A|H_i)
$$</span></p>
<p>can’t fix.</p>
<p>Compared to my goal of <span class="math inline">24/20/9</span>, this is pretty good! I remember distinctly that I didn’t receive that many raise-worthy hands, so I believe that’s why my pre flop raise stat suffered.</p>
<h1 id="session-focus">Session focus</h1>
<p>Yesterday’s session was pretty smooth. I remember feeling collected and patient. I didn’t spew too much. I had created two new tags before it: <em>Good</em> and <em>Bad</em>, and tried to put them to use.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>The good hands! I tagged two as Good.</p>

<p>In this hand, the villain raises to 3BB and I call with KQo. The board on the flop should be pretty advantageous for me, so I put out a probe bet for about 30% of the pot. Also, my hand had nut potential.</p>
<p>So I actually do turn the current nut: Ace high straight. In order to incite worse hands (and draws) to call, I keep my bet a bit on the lower side, 33%. He calls, and the river delivers a 5s which means I do have the nuts. He had called my bets up until that point, so I fire a third barrel for 75% of the pot. This time villain folds. Maybe I was too greedy and should have bet lower, but I’m doubtful he would’ve called anything at that point since he was probably waiting for the third heart to come in.</p>
<p>My probe bet might have been a bit too small. I’m almost giving him a fair price for his draws, considering his implied odds.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this now, I’m not sure I remember if I considered that he could have a flush draw. That makes me wish I had bet more on the flop, and less on the river. Maybe this wasn’t such a <em>Good</em> hand after all.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I remember this one. I’d like to focus on the river, where I clearly have a good hand. Trips with the king kicker. Noteworthy things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Villain raised pre-flop,</li>
<li>and checks behind on flop</li>
<li>doesn’t raise me on the turn, but calls</li>
</ul>
<p>So when the Ace comes up on the river, I think I have the best hand but I’m also pretty sure that villain carries an Ace. That means I could probably get worse hands with an Ace to call larger bets, so I fire away a bet at 75% of the pot’s size and he calls - with AKs!</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>I tagged four hands as Bad, but I’ll show only one (I want to play today, too).</p>

<p>Now I did make “a lot” of money on this hand, but I had misread him and almost punted 93 BBs when I shoved on the turn. I called his raise on the flop since I had OK cards and draws. The Ace came on the turn so I shoved, trying to rep a set of aces or AT. But he called and since he called my raise pre flop and probe bet the flop, I didn’t expect him to show up with AKo. However…</p>
<p>I rivered the straight.</p>
<h2 id="before-todays-session">Before today’s session</h2>
<p>Look at Jonathan Little’s cheat sheet, and pay extra attention to the paragraph about thinking about every action on every street. I could have done that better yesterday. It’s getting late now, I’m not sure I will be able to play for that long.</p>
