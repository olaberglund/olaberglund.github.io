        <p>I played a quite a frustrating, but interesting session yesterday. On the table to my left, I experienced some difficulty against a rather aggressive player, and on my right there was a mad, spewing, Brazilian player seated.</p>
<p>I became tired at the end, and overall didn’t play that well. These were my results:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Total won ($)</th>
<th>VPIP%</th>
<th>PFR%</th>
<th>3Bet%</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>-3.47</td>
<td>23.4</td>
<td>15.2</td>
<td>8.3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, I’m still playing for a couple of cheese burgers at McDonald’s.</p>
<h1 id="session-focus">Session focus</h1>
<p>My pre flop raise stat suffered from having the Brazilian guy constantly going all in. However, that was fine of course. I waited patiently for good hands and either called, or went all in before he called me. I felt that everyone at the table converged towards the same strategy. Also, I couldn’t raise as much as there was a guy on my other table that kept three betting me (often with crap, it was revealed).</p>
<p>Regarding my last post’s pledge to read Jonathan Little’s cheat sheet before the session - I actually forgot that.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>In the future, I’ll save this section for hands that I tagged as ‘Good’.</p>

<p>One of my rules is to overfold to aggression, but I failed to do so on the turn. It turned out to be a semi-bluff by the villain, but I’m not sure why I started betting so aggressively on the flop and turn, when the board is clearly not in my favor as the open raiser.</p>
<h2 id="before-todays-session">Before today’s session</h2>
<p>I’ll read Jonathan Little’s cheat sheet, and remind myself of the tips. Maybe I should put them in Anki.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s see if I can color today’s session green.</p>
