        <p>Yesterday I played 103 hands, and felt card dead most of the time (no, I don’t want to play with J7o, Pokerstars). The best hand I got was AKo, and no fancy pairs better than JJ.</p>

<h1 id="session-focus">Session focus</h1>
<p>I only played one table for the whole session, so that I could focus on every hand, street and opponent. It was slightly more fun than doing two tables, since it was possible to keep track of more things this way.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>I only tagged one hand as good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dealt to Hero: 9s 7c</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTG Raises To $0.04<br />
HJ Folds<br />
CO Folds<br />
BTN Folds<br />
SB Folds<br />
HERO Calls $0.02</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Flop ($0.09): 2d 8d 6c<br />
HERO Checks<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTG Bets $0.05 (Rem. Stack: $0.74)<br />
HERO Raises To $0.15 (Rem. Stack: $1.81)<br />
UTG Folds</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HERO wins: $0.18</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m pretty sure the flop is good for my range (also evidenced by my hand), so I check-raised the continuation bet from the UTG. He folded - great! I also blocked 89, 67.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>It’s easier to tag hands as bad because the hands hurt. I tagged three hands as bad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dealt to Hero: Kd Js</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTG Calls $0.02<br />
HJ Raises To $0.08<br />
CO Folds<br />
HERO Calls $0.08<br />
SB Folds<br />
BB Folds<br />
UTG Folds</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Flop ($0.21): Jd Qd 9h<br />
HJ Bets $0.10 (Rem. Stack: $1.62)<br />
HERO Raises To $0.23 (Rem. Stack: $1.69)<br />
HJ Calls $0.13 (Rem. Stack: $1.49)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn ($0.67): Jd Qd 9h 8d<br />
HJ Checks<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HERO Bets $0.33 (Rem. Stack: $1.36)<br />
HJ Calls $0.33 (Rem. Stack: $1.16)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>River ($1.33): Jd Qd 9h 8d 9c<br />
HJ Checks<br />
HERO Bets $0.64 (Rem. Stack: $0.72)<br />
HJ Calls $0.64 (Rem. Stack: $0.52)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HJ shows: Tc Ad</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HJ wins: $2.50</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not think through each action on the turn and river - just spewed, bluffing.</p>
<h2 id="todays-focus">Today’s focus</h2>
<p>Think through each hand and street, and adjust action to the villain’s stats.</p>
<h2 id="word-of-the-day">Word of the day</h2>
<p><strong>Pot Control</strong> means checking or betting small with the aim of keeping the pot at a small size. Generally done with marginal hands that are uncertain to win at showdown.</p>
