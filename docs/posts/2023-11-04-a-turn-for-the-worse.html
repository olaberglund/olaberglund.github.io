        <p>Last night I played for almost three hours (2:38), and lost “big”.</p>

<p>I played well initially - won many small to medium sized pots. Partly by run-good, but other times it felt like I was trying to apply what I’ve learned and succeeded in bringing down pots with larger sized bets whenever I felt I had a range advantage.</p>
<h1 id="session-focus">Session focus</h1>
<p>While playing, I tried to tag more hands. While I did so, I seem to have forgot to also tag hands where I won the pot.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>I liked this hand.</p>

<p>As the open raiser preflop, he’s the one with the aces and kings in his range. However, he decides to check so I begin putting pressure on the turn, but it was also made easier because of the nine which gave me a two-pair.</p>
<p>It could also be said that the flop hit his range so hard that he should avoid putting a bet, to make me start bluffing. He did call my turn bet and I did bet the river as well. Maybe I shouldn’t have bet so big on the turn, but I find it unlikely that players at my stake would not bet this flop, had they held an ace or a king.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I’m glad I started thinking what the villain could be holding in terms of his range.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>To start off, I failed to raise KTo, K9o, J9o, 98o, and Q8o from the button. I remember that I made a hand on the other table at one instance and folded a marginal hand - it could be one of these. Either way, I can probably take my time while playing and realize that these are playable hands according to my chart.</p>
<p>Next, I’m frustrated by my actions in this hand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dealt to Hero: Kc As</p>
<p>UTG Calls $0.02<br />
HJ Folds<br />
CO Folds<br />
HERO Raises To $0.08<br />
SB Folds<br />
BB Folds<br />
UTG Calls $0.06</p>
<p>Hero SPR on Flop: [12.89 effective]<br />
Flop ($0.19): Jh 3d 4h<br />
UTG Checks<br />
HERO Checks</p>
<p>Turn ($0.19): Jh 3d 4h Kd<br />

HERO Bets $0.09 (Rem. Stack: $3.59)<br />
UTG Calls $0.09 (Rem. Stack: $2.36)</p>
<p>River ($0.37): Jh 3d 4h Kd Qd<br />
UTG Bets $0.52 (Rem. Stack: $1.84)<br />
HERO Calls $0.52 (Rem. Stack: $3.07)</p>
<p>UTG shows: 8d Ad</p>
<p>UTG wins: $1.35</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Villain clearly donked out for value. Why did I call? I believe I failed to overfold throughout this session.</p>
<h2 id="get-specific">Get specific</h2>
<p>I must have lost focus on the fundamental rules of my stakes: overfold to aggression and don’t hero call.</p>
<h2 id="before-next-session">Before next session</h2>
<p>Before today’s session, I’ll read through Jonathan Little’s cheat sheet.</p>
