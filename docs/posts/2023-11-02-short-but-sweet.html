        <p>Today I played for 43 minutes and 130 hands. As per usual, I had a chart for 3-betting ranges on my side, beside David Kaye’s Twitch live stream.</p>
<p>This was the outcome:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Total won</th>
<th>VPIP%</th>
<th>PFR%</th>
<th>3Bet%</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>$1.35</td>
<td>23.3</td>
<td>19.4</td>
<td>11.8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I’m pleased with this! I’m trying to achieve the slightly arbitrary <span class="math inline">24/20/9</span>, and I was almost right on the money today.</p>
<p>I also had the idea of filling out the “Things to focus on AFTER your cash session” for each session here on my blog. So this is the first one!</p>
<h1 id="session-focus">Session Focus</h1>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>Primarily, I was proud of having paid attention enough to one guy in particular so that I had something that looked like a read.</p>
<h3 id="the-read">The read</h3>
<p>I distinctly remember taking notice of one of the opponents’ style of playing. Betting too fiercely multi-way and on disadvantageous boards.</p>
<p>The guy reached the stats: 75/36/16. So he was obviously loose and quite aggressive (which I didn’t know at first). We played 83 hands together.</p>
<p>The most memorable hand was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dealt to Hero: Kc Ts</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTG Folds, HJ Folds, CO Raises To $0.06, BTN Calls $0.06, SB Folds, HERO Calls $0.04</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hero SPR on Flop: [10.21 effective]
Flop ($0.19): Tc 5c 3s
HERO Checks, CO Checks, BTN Checks</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn ($0.19): Tc 5c 3s 4d
HERO Checks, CO Bets $0.06 (Rem. Stack: $2.43), BTN Calls $0.06 (Rem. Stack: $1.88), HERO Calls $0.06 (Rem. Stack: $1.88)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>River ($0.37): Tc 5c 3s 4d 8h
HERO Checks, CO Bets $0.36 (Rem. Stack: $2.07), BTN Folds, HERO Calls $0.36 (Rem. Stack: $1.52)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CO shows: As 8d</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HERO wins: $1.05</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, I called the raise in the BB with KTo. SB decides bet just below 1/3 on a disadvantageous board for the pre flop raiser. The board not is not connected, save for the two clubs (but I hold the king of clubs).</p>
<p>The button folds on the river to a pot bet, but I don’t see how he could be so confident on such a runout so I call. Turns out he held A8o, and bet a bit out of line as I thought.</p>
<h3 id="range-betting">Range betting</h3>
<p>After having open raised with 77 in the CO the BU calls. Flop comes KA4 rainbow. This is a pretty good board for the open raiser, so I bet 1/3 and he folds. He had a tight stat line, and had never 3 bet during the 58 hands which suggests he’s passive too. Had he called, I would probably fired a second barrel as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>Primarily, I should remember to tag hands. I used to be better at it.</p>
<h3 id="hand-tagging">Hand Tagging</h3>
<p>I didn’t tag any hands. I should do that so that I can easily access them later when writing the review.</p>
<h3 id="hand-deviation">Hand Deviation</h3>
<p>I folded 97s in the CO, which I should’ve raised.</p>
<ul>
<li>BU: 34/18/0 (38 hands)</li>
<li>SB: 73/0/0 (15 hands)</li>
<li>BB: 11/10/5 (61 hands)</li>
</ul>
<p>Button seems to be opening a bit on the looser side. 38 hands doesn’t reveal any obvious tells.</p>
<p>Small blind seems loose with his limps.</p>
<p>Button seems to be a nit.</p>
<p>I think I definitely could have raised the 97s here. I probably want to make the SB pay for subscribing to the flop, and steal the blinds from the nit in the big blind. Button seems trickier, but his low 3 bet frequency helps my case.</p>
<h2 id="get-specific">Get specific</h2>
<p>I think I have a hard time with lower suited connectors, since I doubt my pre-flop skills. In time, when I develop a sense for range betting and consideration for my opponent, I might feel more confident with these.</p>
<h2 id="before-next-session">Before next session</h2>
<p>I need to freshen up the ideas around suited connectors. Especially, what to do when I raise with them. What is my range, then?</p>
