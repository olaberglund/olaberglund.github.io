# Session focus

It has been a couple of days since I last played a session. Now that I return and check my stats, I notice that I am closing in on my record loss of $25.78. I might be failing at underbluffing and overfolding, because my won-at-showdown has gone way down and my non-win-at-showdown is just as usual trending downwards. Anyway, last session started well but took a turn for the worse later in the session.

| Total won ($) | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |

## The good

Sadly, I didn't tag any hand as good.

## The bad

I tagged two hands as bad. What about this one:

> Dealt to Hero: 4h Jd

> UTG Folds \
> HJ Calls $0.02 \
> CO Calls $0.02 \
> BTN Folds \
> SB Folds \
> HERO Checks

> Flop ($0.07): 9s Js 7d \
> HERO Checks \

> HJ Bets $0.07 (Rem. Stack: $1.22) \
> CO Calls $0.07 (Rem. Stack: $0.67) \
> HERO Calls $0.07 (Rem. Stack: $1.91)

> Turn ($0.28): 9s Js 7d Td \
> HERO Checks \
> HJ Checks \
> CO Checks

> River ($0.28): 9s Js 7d Td 3s \
> HERO Checks \
> HJ Checks \
> CO Bets $0.27 (Rem. Stack: $0.40) \
> HERO Calls $0.27 (Rem. Stack: $1.64) \
> HJ Folds

> CO shows: 7s Ks

> CO wins: $0.79

I shouldn't have called his pot bet, considering we were multi-way on the river and I only had a jack. People rarely bluff on the river.

I can't remember what note I had laid on him, but it was something specific to how he had played a hand earlier. Either way, with that read I began firing on the flop, and continued on the turn but stopped on the river because he did only call my open raise and the flop is theoretically better for him I believe. However, he shows up with AKo and I win the hand.

Not sure what to make of this hand - I wish I remember what note I had on him.

## Before today's session

I'll freshen up my memory of Little's cheat sheet. Looking forward to play some hands.
