Yesterday I played 103 hands, and felt card dead most of the time (no, I don't want to play with J7o, Pokerstars). The best hand I got was AKo, and no fancy pairs better than JJ.

# Session focus

I only played one table for the whole session, so that I could focus on every hand, street and opponent. It was slightly more fun than doing two tables, since it was possible to keep track of more things this way.

## The good

I only tagged one hand as good:

> Dealt to Hero: 9s 7c

> UTG Raises To $0.04 \
> HJ Folds \
> CO Folds \
> BTN Folds \
> SB Folds \
> HERO Calls $0.02

> Flop ($0.09): 2d 8d 6c \
> HERO Checks \

> UTG Bets $0.05 (Rem. Stack: $0.74) \
> HERO Raises To $0.15 (Rem. Stack: $1.81) \
> UTG Folds

> HERO wins: $0.18

I'm pretty sure the flop is good for my range (also evidenced by my hand), so I check-raised the continuation bet from the UTG. He folded - great! I also blocked 89, 67.

## The bad

It's easier to tag hands as bad because the hands hurt. I tagged three hands as bad.

> Dealt to Hero: Kd Js

> UTG Calls $0.02 \
> HJ Raises To $0.08 \
> CO Folds \
> HERO Calls $0.08 \
> SB Folds \
> BB Folds \
> UTG Folds

> Flop ($0.21): Jd Qd 9h \
> HJ Bets $0.10 (Rem. Stack: $1.62) \
> HERO Raises To $0.23 (Rem. Stack: $1.69) \
> HJ Calls $0.13 (Rem. Stack: $1.49)

> Turn ($0.67): Jd Qd 9h 8d \
> HJ Checks \

> HERO Bets $0.33 (Rem. Stack: $1.36) \
> HJ Calls $0.33 (Rem. Stack: $1.16)

> River ($1.33): Jd Qd 9h 8d 9c \
> HJ Checks \
> HERO Bets $0.64 (Rem. Stack: $0.72) \
> HJ Calls $0.64 (Rem. Stack: $0.52)

> HJ shows: Tc Ad

> HJ wins: $2.50

I did not think through each action on the turn and river - just spewed, bluffing.

## Today's focus

Think through each hand and street, and adjust action to the villain's stats.

## Word of the day

**Pot Control** means checking or betting small with the aim of keeping the pot at a small size. Generally done with marginal hands that are uncertain to win at showdown.
