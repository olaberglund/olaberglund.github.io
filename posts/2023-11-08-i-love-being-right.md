# Session focus

Yesterday's session wasn't great. It wasn't bad either! Although I was card dead for most of the time, a revelation struck me during one hand. I don't have that much against losing money, as long as I am right. I hate being wrong.

| Total won ($) | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| -2.56         | 20.3  | 15.4 | 5.3   |

## The good

I distinctly remember tagging one certain hand as good, and apparently there was only one:

> Dealt to Hero: Td As
>
> UTG Folds \
> HERO Raises To $0.06 \
> CO Calls $0.06 \
> BTN Calls $0.06 \
> SB Folds \
> BB Folds

> Flop ($0.21): 9s Ac 9h \
> HERO Bets $0.07 (Rem. Stack: $1.87) \

> CO Folds \
> BTN Raises To $0.41 (Rem. Stack: $0.74) \
> HERO Calls $0.34 (Rem. Stack: $1.53)

> Turn ($1.03): 9s Ac 9h 6h \
> HERO Checks \

> BTN Bets $0.74 (allin) \
> HERO Calls $0.74 (Rem. Stack: $0.79)

> River ($2.51): 9s Ac 9h 6h 5h

> BTN shows: 8c 7s

> BTN wins: $2.42

So I begin by raising, and although I didn't think too much of the button's short stack, I believe my hand is good enough to raise in any case. Both the CO and BTN calls. The flop should hit my range pretty hard, and I have an ace, so I raise by a third.

The button raises, massively. I don't remember what read I had on the guy, but I'm pretty sure I found him very LAG, and bad. I have an ace, and it's pretty unlikely he has a nine (there's two on the board), so I call. On the turn, he goes in with the rest. I figured he's bluffing, so I called. I was right. My equity was way higher than his, but he rivered a straight and took down the pot. I first thought that it sucked, but then came to the realization that if I keep calling all-ins with 84.1% equity, then I'd be very glad. I'm still playing for cheese burgers, so I'm just glad I was right.

## For review

I didn't tag any hands as specifically bad, but I did put the tag _for review_ on one:

> Dealt to Hero: As Qs

> UTG Raises To $0.04 \
> HJ Folds \
> CO Folds \
> BTN Folds \
> SB Folds \
> HERO Raises To $0.16 \
> UTG Raises To $0.40 \
> HERO Calls $0.24

> Flop ($0.81): 2d 4c Jh \
> HERO Checks \
> UTG Checks

> Turn ($0.81): 2d 4c Jh 6c \
> HERO Checks \
> UTG Checks

> River ($0.81): 2d 4c Jh 6c 2s \
> HERO Checks \
> UTG Checks

> UTG shows: Ad Kc \

> UTG wins: $0.78 \

After the guy 4bet me, he had only 10BBs left in his stack. In hindsight, maybe I should have gone all in. The action was very awkward during the rest of the streets where none of use gained anything. He still had only 10BB, which I noted during the hand, but I don't think a bet would have made him fold, since he only had 10BB behind and much more invested. So to not lose more, I just check down and lose. Pretty sad hand.

## Before today's session

I'll read about what I should do against shorter stacked players at my table in cash games. And as per usual, remind myself of the tips in Little's cheat sheet.
