# Session focus

It is very often that I gather a profit initially during a session, and then lose it and end with a net loss. This time, I tried to play a little shorter session. About an hour instead of one and a half.

| Total won ($) | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 2.59          | 19.6  | 12.4 | 7.9   |

# The good

I only tagged one hand as good:

> Dealt to Hero: 4s Qc

> UTG Folds \
> HJ Folds \
> CO Calls $0.02 \
> BTN Folds \
> SB Folds \
> HERO Checks

> Flop ($0.05): 6h 5h Jc \
> HERO Checks \
> CO Bets $0.02 (Rem. Stack: $1.01) \
> HERO Raises To $0.05 (Rem. Stack: $2.02) \
> CO Calls $0.03 (Rem. Stack: $0.98)

> Turn ($0.15): 6h 5h Jc 6c \
> HERO Bets $0.11 (Rem. Stack: $1.91) \
> CO Calls $0.11 (Rem. Stack: $0.87)

> River ($0.37): 6h 5h Jc 6c 2h \
> HERO Bets $0.27 (Rem. Stack: $1.64) \
> CO Folds

> HERO wins: $0.36

But this hand wasn't good at all! I'm pretty sure I realized that soon after I tagged it as good. My biggest mistake was betting big on the river, when the hearts came in. Villain could have been calling me down because he had a flush draw.

My initial thought was that the flop was good for my range, and I believe it was, but I should not have spewed like I did on the river. He did fold, but I was probably just lucky. I should think _each_ action through.

## Before today's session

I'll begin writing on the next post as soon as I begin playing today's session. That way, I can make notes and keep them for the review (my usual notes always disappear).
