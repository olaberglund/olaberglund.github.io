title: A turn for the worse
---

Last night I played for almost three hours (2:38), and lost "big".

| Total won ($) | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| -5.45         | 24.4  | 19.7 | 11.4  |

I played well initially - won many small to medium sized pots. Partly by run-good, but other times it felt like I was trying to apply what I've learned and succeeded in bringing down pots with larger sized bets whenever I felt I had a range advantage.

# Session focus

While playing, I tried to tag more hands. While I did so, I seem to have forgot to also tag hands where I won the pot.

## The good

I liked this hand.

As the open raiser preflop, he's the one with the aces and kings in his range. However, he decides to check so I begin putting pressure on the turn, but it was also made easier because of the nine which gave me a two-pair.

It could also be said that the flop hit his range so hard that he should avoid putting a bet, to make me start bluffing. He did call my turn bet and I did bet the river as well. Maybe I shouldn't have bet so big on the turn, but I find it unlikely that players at my stake would not bet this flop, had they held an ace or a king.

In conclusion, I'm glad I started thinking what the villain could be holding in terms of his range.

## The bad

To start off, I failed to raise KTo, K9o, J9o, 98o, and Q8o from the button. I remember that I made a hand on the other table at one instance and folded a marginal hand - it could be one of these. Either way, I can probably take my time while playing and realize that these are playable hands according to my chart.

Next, I'm frustrated by my actions in this hand:

> HERO Calls $0.52 (Rem. Stack: $3.07)

> UTG wins: $1.35

Villain clearly donked out for value. Why did I call? I believe I failed to overfold throughout this session.

## Get specific

I must have lost focus on the fundamental rules of my stakes: overfold to aggression and don't hero call.
