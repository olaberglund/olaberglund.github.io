# Session focus

Last session, I again managed to book a win! Good stuff. I played for 1:13 and a total of 183 hands. The outcome was this:

| Total won ($) | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 1.84          | 26.6  | 17.5 | 13    |

So I managed to raise a bunch of hands this time, and overall I was pretty satisified with the session. If I remember correctly, I stopped playing when I started loosing focus.

I actually had a note on the guy:

> he plays too many hands, too aggressively. showed up with AKo either way

So I believed my hand was best the most of times, and called his all-in. Luckily, that was the case although he did show up with AKo.

I'm not sure if I played this well, so I tagged it for review. The guy had moderately high stats overall, so he seemed to be a somewhat good LAG. I raise his continuation bet since the board hit my range pretty hard. I'm not sure I should've bet turn though, since that should hit his harder. But I do, and loose gas on the river, check down and lose. Maybe I shouldn't have bet the turn.
