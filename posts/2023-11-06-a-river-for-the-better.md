title: A river for the better
---

I've gotten into the habit of writing these analyses before the day's session. It's nice, as I have time to digest whatever happened during the session and cool down from whatever tilt that came from it. Yesterday's outcome:

| Total won ($) | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |
| ------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 1.92          | 23.5  | 17.4 | 8.9   |

Actually, the session was split up in two, but for the stats that's not something a little

$$
P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}P(H_i)P(A|H_i)
$$

can't fix.

Compared to my goal of $24/20/9$, this is pretty good! I remember distinctly that I didn't receive that many raise-worthy hands, so I believe that's why my pre flop raise stat suffered.

# Session focus

Yesterday's session was pretty smooth. I remember feeling collected and patient. I didn't spew too much. I had created two new tags before it: _Good_ and _Bad_, and tried to put them to use.

## The good

The good hands! I tagged two as Good.

### The first hand

> Dealt to Hero: Qh Kc

> HERO Raises To $0.04 \

> BTN Folds \
> SB Folds \
> BB Raises To $0.06 \
> HERO Calls $0.02

> Flop ($0.13): 7d Th Jh \
> BB Checks \
> HERO Bets $0.04 (Rem. Stack: $2.03) \
> BB Calls $0.04 (Rem. Stack: $2.13)

> Turn ($0.21): 7d Th Jh As
> BB Checks \
> HERO Bets $0.07 (Rem. Stack: $1.96) \
> BB Calls $0.07 (Rem. Stack: $2.06)

> River ($0.35): 7d Th Jh As 5c \
> BB Checks \
> HERO Bets $0.26 (Rem. Stack: $1.70) \
> BB Folds

> HERO wins: $0.34

In this hand, the villain raises to 3BB and I call with KQo. The board on the flop should be pretty advantageous for me, so I put out a probe bet for about 30% of the pot. Also, my hand had nut potential.

So I actually do turn the current nut: Ace high straight. In order to incite worse hands (and draws) to call, I keep my bet a bit on the lower side, 33%. He calls, and the river delivers a 5s which means I do have the nuts. He had called my bets up until that point, so I fire a third barrel for 75% of the pot. This time villain folds. Maybe I was too greedy and should have bet lower, but I'm doubtful he would've called anything at that point since he was probably waiting for the third heart to come in.

My probe bet might have been a bit too small. I'm almost giving him a fair price for his draws, considering his implied odds.

As I'm writing this now, I'm not sure I remember if I considered that he could have a flush draw. That makes me wish I had bet more on the flop, and less on the river. Maybe this wasn't such a _Good_ hand after all.

### The second hand

> Dealt to Hero: Kc Js
>
> UTG Raises To $0.04 \
> HJ Folds \
> CO Folds \
> BTN Folds \
> SB Folds \
> HERO Calls $0.02
>
> Flop ($0.09): 6d Qd Jh \
> HERO Checks \
> UTG Checks
>
> Turn ($0.09): 6d Qd Jh Jc \
> HERO Bets $0.03 (Rem. Stack: $1.93) \
> UTG Calls $0.03 (Rem. Stack: $1.61)
>
> River ($0.15): 6d Qd Jh Jc Ac \
> HERO Bets $0.11 (Rem. Stack: $1.82) \
> UTG Calls $0.11 (Rem. Stack: $1.50)
>
> UTG shows: As Ks
>
> HERO wins: $0.36

Oh yeah, I remember this one. I'd like to focus on the river, where I clearly have a good hand. Trips with the king kicker. Noteworthy things:

- Villain raised pre-flop,
- and checks behind on flop
- doesn't raise me on the turn, but calls

So when the Ace comes up on the river, I think I have the best hand but I'm also pretty sure that villain carries an Ace. That means I could probably get worse hands with an Ace to call larger bets, so I fire away a bet at 75% of the pot's size and he calls - with AKs!

## The bad

I tagged four hands as Bad, but I'll show only one (I want to play today, too).

> Dealt to Hero: Kh Qc
>
> UTG Folds \
> HJ Folds \
> HERO Raises To $0.06 \
> BTN Folds \
> SB Raises To $0.20 \
> BB Folds \
> HERO Calls $0.14
>
> Flop ($0.42): 9d 9h Ts \
> SB Bets $0.21 (Rem. Stack: $1.01) \
> HERO Calls $0.21 (Rem. Stack: $1.86)
>
> Turn ($0.84): 9d 9h Ts As \
> SB Checks \
> HERO Bets $1.86 (allin) \
> SB Calls $1.01 (allin)
>
> River ($3.71): 9d 9h Ts As Jd
>
> SB shows: Ks Ah
>
> HERO wins: $2.76

Now I did make "a lot" of money on this hand, but I had misread him and almost punted 93 BBs when I shoved on the turn. I called his raise on the flop since I had OK cards and draws. The Ace came on the turn so I shoved, trying to rep a set of aces or AT. But he called and since he called my raise pre flop and probe bet the flop, I didn't expect him to show up with AKo. However...

I rivered the straight.

## Before today's session

Look at Jonathan Little's cheat sheet, and pay extra attention to the paragraph about thinking about every action on every street. I could have done that better yesterday. It's getting late now, I'm not sure I will be able to play for that long.
