title: Brazilian madness
---

I played a quite a frustrating, but interesting session yesterday. On the table to my left, I experienced some difficulty against a rather aggressive player, and on my right there was a mad, spewing, Brazilian player seated.

I became tired at the end, and overall didn't play that well. These were my results:

| Total won (\$) | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |
| -------------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| -3.47          | 23.4  | 15.2 | 8.3   |

As you can see, I'm still playing for a couple of cheese burgers at McDonald's.

# Session focus

My pre flop raise stat suffered from having the Brazilian guy constantly going all in. However, that was fine of course. I waited patiently for good hands and either called, or went all in before he called me. I felt that everyone at the table converged towards the same strategy. Also, I couldn't raise as much as there was a guy on my other table that kept three betting me (often with crap, it was revealed).

Regarding my last post's pledge to read Jonathan Little's cheat sheet before the session - I actually forgot that.

## The good

In the future, I'll save this section for hands that I tagged as 'Good'.

One of my rules is to overfold to aggression, but I failed to do so on the turn. It turned out to be a semi-bluff by the villain, but I'm not sure why I started betting so aggressively on the flop and turn, when the board is clearly not in my favor as the open raiser.

## Before today's session

I'll read Jonathan Little's cheat sheet, and remind myself of the tips. Maybe I should put them in Anki.

Alright, let's see if I can color today's session green.
