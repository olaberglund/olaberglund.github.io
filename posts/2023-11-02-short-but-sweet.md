Today I played for 43 minutes and 130 hands. As per usual, I had a chart for 3-betting ranges on my side, beside David Kaye's Twitch live stream.

This was the outcome:

| Total won | VPIP% | PFR% | 3Bet% |
| --------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| $1.35     | 23.3  | 19.4 | 11.8  |

I'm pleased with this! I'm trying to achieve the slightly arbitrary $24/20/9$, and I was almost right on the money today.

I also had the idea of filling out the "Things to focus on AFTER your cash session" for each session here on my blog. So this is the first one!

# Session Focus

## The Good

Primarily, I was proud of having paid attention enough to one guy in particular so that I had something that looked like a read.

### The read

I distinctly remember taking notice of one of the opponents' style of playing. Betting too fiercely multi-way and on disadvantageous boards.

The guy reached the stats: 75/36/16. So he was obviously loose and quite aggressive (which I didn't know at first). We played 83 hands together.

The most memorable hand was this:

> Dealt to Hero: Kc Ts

> UTG Folds, HJ Folds, CO Raises To $0.06, BTN Calls $0.06, SB Folds, HERO Calls $0.04

> Hero SPR on Flop: [10.21 effective]
> Flop ($0.19): Tc 5c 3s
> HERO Checks, CO Checks, BTN Checks

> Turn ($0.19): Tc 5c 3s 4d
> HERO Checks, CO Bets $0.06 (Rem. Stack: $2.43), BTN Calls $0.06 (Rem. Stack: $1.88), HERO Calls $0.06 (Rem. Stack: $1.88)

> River ($0.37): Tc 5c 3s 4d 8h
> HERO Checks, CO Bets $0.36 (Rem. Stack: $2.07), BTN Folds, HERO Calls $0.36 (Rem. Stack: $1.52)

> CO shows: As 8d

> HERO wins: $1.05

That is, I called the raise in the BB with KTo. SB decides bet just below 1/3 on a disadvantageous board for the pre flop raiser. The board not is not connected, save for the two clubs (but I hold the king of clubs).

The button folds on the river to a pot bet, but I don't see how he could be so confident on such a runout so I call. Turns out he held A8o, and bet a bit out of line as I thought.

### Range betting

After having open raised with 77 in the CO the BU calls. Flop comes KA4 rainbow. This is a pretty good board for the open raiser, so I bet 1/3 and he folds. He had a tight stat line, and had never 3 bet during the 58 hands which suggests he's passive too. Had he called, I would probably fired a second barrel as well.

## The Bad

Primarily, I should remember to tag hands. I used to be better at it.

### Hand Tagging

I didn't tag any hands. I should do that so that I can easily access them later when writing the review.

### Hand Deviation

I folded 97s in the CO, which I should've raised.

- BU: 34/18/0 (38 hands)
- SB: 73/0/0 (15 hands)
- BB: 11/10/5 (61 hands)

Button seems to be opening a bit on the looser side. 38 hands doesn't reveal any obvious tells.

Small blind seems loose with his limps.

Button seems to be a nit.

I think I definitely could have raised the 97s here. I probably want to make the SB pay for subscribing to the flop, and steal the blinds from the nit in the big blind. Button seems trickier, but his low 3 bet frequency helps my case.

## Get specific

I think I have a hard time with lower suited connectors, since I doubt my pre-flop skills. In time, when I develop a sense for range betting and consideration for my opponent, I might feel more confident with these.

## Before next session

I need to freshen up the ideas around suited connectors. Especially, what to do when I raise with them. What is my range, then?
